=head1 NAME

App::pscan::Command::tcp - test the ip with the tcp protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tcp scan of a given range of the format of Net::IP and a port range.
e.g.: 192.168.1.0/24:80
      192.168.1.1:20-90
      www.google.it:70-80

=head1 OPTIONS

-p or --payload specify a payload to send within the request
